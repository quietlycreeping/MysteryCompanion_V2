          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            You built your empire brick by brick, one deal, one betrayal, one perfectly timed move at a time. Where others rely on brute force or supernatural abilities, you thrive on manipulation, strategy, and knowing exactly how to make people dance to your tune. In the Villains Vanguard, power shifts like a well-played game of chess, and you always intend to be three moves ahead. You are no mere criminal—you are a mastermind.
<br><br>
The Villains Vanguard, originally formed by Dracula, Jafar, Maleficent, and Ursula, was meant to unite villains in a singular vision of world domination. Over time, it has grown, segmented, and become a more complicated beast. That's where you come in. You've made it your mission to form an inner alliance within the Villains Vanguard—a network of superhero villains, the ones who built their reputations in the shadows of heroes and know how to play both sides of the game. More of your kind in the ranks means more influence for you, and more control over the future.
<br><br>
Of course, this plan is not without obstacles. Joker, a wildcard in every sense of the word, can never be trusted to vote the way he promises. In the last election, you agreed to vote together to get Harley Quinn admitted to the Villains Vanguard. However, you suspect Joker changed his vote and was the reason Cruella Deville—a villain with no real power—was inducted last round. Because of this, Harley has been left feeling overlooked. Either way, you can't rely on voting anyone in safely without assurance that Joker will vote together with you.
<br><br>
Then, there's Maleficent's latest amendment—a proposal to limit future inductees to only those with supernatural or magical abilities. If passed, this could cripple your efforts, keeping brilliant but non-magical minds like Harley Quinn out. You don't need to worry about yourself—you're already in—but the villains you're backing? That's another story.
<br><br>
One person you should keep close? Hannibal Lecter. Another non-magical powerhouse, they believe themselves to be smarter than you. Let them believe it—for now. You have bigger plans. The Blood Moon Celebration is approaching and you can't wait to attend. It will be a night of whispered deals, subtle alliances, and carefully placed influence. You'll charm, scheme, and ensure that by the time the night is over, the board is set exactly how you want it. After all, the best crime is one no one sees coming.
