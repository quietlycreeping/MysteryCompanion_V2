          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            As Santa's husband, your duties are wide and varied. Being the matriarch of the North Pole, not only do you provide for your wife and your daughter, but you keep a close, 
            fatherly eye on the elves and the reindeer at the North Pole.<br><br>

            Over the years, you have helped Santa to foster a loving and caring environment capable of delivering toys to all of the girls and boys worldwide. Unfortunately, due to the 
            growing population, new technology and an increase in the materialistic and self-indulgent perspectives regarding Christmas, production at the North Pole is anticipated to 
            fall short of the demand this yearâ€”something that would tarnish Santa's legacy. Fearing this outcome, Santa has vowed to review all of the processes at the North Pole and to 
            make changes that improve efficiency.<br><br>

            While delivering treats to the elves, you have heard rumors that Santa and Jingle may be purchasing toy design plans from Matteo (a major toy company). Since part of Santa's 
            legacy is dependent on all of the toys being original creations from the elves, if discovered, this would certainly put Santa's reputation at risk. Considering how the stress 
            of the situation has been weighing on Santa, you feel it is your job to make sure that she does not do anything drastic which could ruin her legacy forever!<br><br>

            Along with your duties, you keep a close eye on your daughter, Connie. Raised at the North Pole, you expected Connie to be filled with a giving Christmas spirit, but she is not. 
            Jaded by the lack of attention from Santa, Connie has often sought out the attention of some elves to give her the comfort and love she desires. It is no surprise to you that Connie 
            loathes Rudolph  and Jingle, two of Santa's closest confidants.<br><br>

            Recently, you have noticed that Connie has been consorting with Blinky, a very ambitious elf. While you hope that Blinky's intentions with your daughter are honorable, you suspect that 
            Blinky is using his relationship with Connie to gain favor with Santa, or worse, plotting something evil with Connie.<br><br>

            Santa has made it clear that she wishes to retire in a few years and has recruited Kristy Krangle to be her apprentice at the North Pole. It is apparent to you that Santa would like Kristy 
            to marry Connie, so that Santa can pass the legacy down through the family. Although these are Santa's intentions, you are unsure whether Connie will fall in love with Kristy and, if she does, 
            that she will follow her mother's wishes.<br><br>

            Knowing Connie's rocky relationship with Santa, you realize that Connie is capable of doing anything out of vengeance. While you would like for Connie to marry for love, you are not willing to 
            risk losing your integrity and legacy just so your daughter can spite her mother.<br><br>

            As the Holly, Jolly Christmas Party quickly approaches, you are excited to attend. Santa has planned the party to boost the morale at the North Pole, as well as to gain information on how to best 
            improve the situation. You plan to use the party to make sure that Santa, or anyone else, does nothing to jeopardize your legacy!

            As the paternal figure for many at the party, you possess a kind and giving nature. However, when people cross you or your family, you will do whatever it takes to preserve your family stability and 
            the legacy that you have created.</p>
