          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            You've been called many things—a menace, a mastermind, a wild card—but above all, you are an agent of chaos. Your past is a tangled mess of conflicting stories, and honestly, you like it that way. The less people know, the more they fear. You've had your maniacal days, and while the old you might've thrived on destruction for the fun of it, these days you're trying to settle down—at least, for Harley Quinn's sake. He deserves a boyfriend who isn't constantly off chasing the next thrill... or voting against him in elections just to stir the pot.
<br><br>
Yes, you may have done that last time. Without Harley's knowledge, you agreed to vote with Kingpin to get Harley Quinn into the Villains Vanguard. At the last minute, Maleficent proposed that you vote together for Cruella Deville—a completely random choice—being elected into the Villains Vanguard. Oops. This worked in your favor; you and Maleficent are now able to use your past support to manipulate Cruella's current actions.
<br><br>
You and Harley have been (mostly) on since then, and you've realized something: he really wants in. So, for once, you're focusing, staying on track, and doing what you can to make that happen. That includes calming your more erratic tendencies with a little help from Poison Ivy's botanicals—because a chill Joker is a more persuasive Joker.
<br><br>
The Villains Vanguard was founded long ago by Dracula, Jafar, Maleficent, and Ursula, a
collection of the most feared figures in history, united with one goal—world domination. Since then, the Villains Vanguard has grown, carefully selecting new members every few years. You earned your place among them, proving that sheer unpredictability is just as valuable as brute force. But lately, things have been getting... stale. The real fun is in watching power shift, and right now, you have a chance to nudge things in a more entertaining direction.You know exactly where to start—Dracula. If the vote ends in a tie, the decision goes to the villain with the most seniority, and he's the guy.
<br><br>
The Blood Moon Celebration is shaping up to be deliciously entertaining, and you can't wait to attend! It's sure to be a night of whispers, double-crosses, and little accidents waiting to happen. You'll shake hands, make deals, and if things don't go your way? Well, there's always room for a little mayhem. After all, what's a party without a few surprises?
