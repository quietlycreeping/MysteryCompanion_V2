          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            You are power wrapped in silk and saltwater, a force as relentless as the tide. Once a contender for the throne of Atlantica, your exile did not break you—it only made you smarter. Where brute strength fails, you weave spells, strike bargains, and twist desperation into power. You learned long ago that true dominance isn't taken by force—it's earned through whispers, deals, and knowing exactly when to pull the strings. That is why you co-founded the Villains Vanguard alongside Dracula, Jafar, and Maleficent—a coalition of the most feared and cunning villains, united by a single goal: world domination.
<br><br>
Over time, the Villains Vanguard expanded, inducting new members every few years to strengthen its grip. But the balance of power has shifted, and you are no longer content to sit back and let Maleficent dictate its future. For years, she and Dracula led—or rather, Maleficent led, and Dracula followed. Additionally, somewhere along the way, Maleficent decided she was greater than you. A mistake. Maleficent may wield her magic effortlessly, but she has forgotten one simple truth—witches work for their power, and that makes them stronger. You intend to remind her of that.
<br><br>
Cracks have begun to form in her rule, and you are ready to slip through them. The once- unshakable bond between Dracula and Maleficent has weakened, and of all the choices Maleficent could have made, she voted to induct Cruella Deville—a villain with no real power to speak of. That, of course, makes Cruella useful. You have considered offering Cruella something Maleficent never will—friendship. A dangerous promise, but one that could tilt the scales in your favor. 
<br><br>
But your real focus? The witches. With the next election approaching, you intend to rally the other witches and ensure that magic remains a dominant force in the Villains Vanguard. You are leaning toward backing Evil Queen, but she can be vain and frivolous. You will keep your options open for a more formidable choice—power belongs to those who adapt.
<br><br>
The Blood Moon Celebration is your perfect stage, and you can't wait for the event. It will be a night of whispered conversations, carefully planted ideas, and shaky alliances shifting like ocean currents. You are eager to attend, to test the waters, to see who is swayed by influence and who can be pulled into your tide. Maleficent may think she rules the Villains Vanguard, but by the end of the night, you plan to leave her wondering just how deep your magic runs.
