          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            Once, you were a priestess, devoted and revered. Then, you were cursed, transformed into a legend of terror, your beauty replaced with snakes and a gaze that could turn the strongest warrior to stone. You did not choose this fate, but you embraced it. Fear is its own form of power, and you have wielded yours with precision ever since. Now, you set your sights on something far greater—the Villains Vanguard, a coalition founded by Dracula, Jafar, Maleficent, and Ursula, dedicated to world domination. You belong among them, not as a mere candidate, but as a force to be reckoned with.
<br><br>
This is not your first time on the ballot, and frankly, you wish it were your last. At the last election, you were certain of your victory—Dracula and Maleficent's support should have secured your place. But then, out of nowhere, Cruella Deville was inducted instead. Cruella! A villain with no real power, no legacy, no right to stand where you should have been standing. It was an insult, a slight you do not intend to endure again.
<br><br>
So, you will try once more—this time with a different approach. No uncertainty, no doubt. You will carry yourself as though you are already a member, ensuring that others see your confidence and cast their votes accordingly. You have already heard whispers of Maleficent's new proposal—an amendment that would restrict future inductees to those with supernatural or magical abilities. Convenient. That rule would work in your favor, securing your position while blocking out weaker contenders. However, considering last election, you are not certain Maleficent or Dracula can be trusted to stand behind their word.
<br><br>
Still, you understand the dangers of ambition. There are others, like the Queen of Hearts, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy, who dream of joining the Villains Vanguard just as you do. They may be allies for now, but the ballot has a way of turning aspirations into rivalries. You intend to keep them close—advising, guiding, and when necessary, reminding them what it means to be left out.
<br><br>
The Blood Moon Celebration is your chance to set things right, and it can't come soon enough! Make it a night of strategizing, whispering promises, and ensuring your name is spoken with admiration, fear, and certainty. You have waited long enough. This time, you will not be overlooked.

            Move with measured confidence, your steps silent but deliberate, enough to make even the boldest villain uneasy.
Speak softly with a knowing smirk—after all, they should fear you.
