          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            You have ruled, bewitched, and commanded admiration for centuries. Your beauty is legendary, your cunning unmatched, and yet, the Villains Vanguard has refused to grant you what is rightfully yours—a seat among them. Founded by Dracula, Jafar, Maleficent, and Ursula, the Villains Vanguard was created for world domination, and you, with your unrivaled charm, intelligence, and magic, belong in its ranks. Yet, they continue to overlook you, choosing lesser villains, unworthy names, while you remain on the ballot. It is infuriating.
<br><br>
This time, you refuse to be denied. You will lobby harder than ever, insuring that every vote is in your favor. You have one ally—or so you believe—in Ursula, the sea witch. As another powerful sorceress, Ursula has faced Maleficent's challenges firsthand. Ursula has made it very clear that she wants more witches in the Villains Vanguard, likely to solidify her own standing. That works for you—as long as Ursula keeps her word.
<br><br>
The real thorn in your side? Cruella Deville, the newest member of the Villains Vanguard and one who vastly overestimates her power. The two of you are already at odds, locked in an unspoken battle over who is truly the fairest of them all. It is laughable—you are, of course, superior. Not only is your beauty ageless, but you have developed a botanical-infused cream, sourced from Poison Ivy, that gives your skin a divine glow. Cruella knows she cannot compete, and that is precisely why she resents you.
<br><br>
But beauty alone will not secure your place—you need votes. Ursula, another witch, is going to be the easiest way you think you can solicit them. However, getting into the Villains Vanguard has not proved to be as easy as it sounds. Joker, Harley Quinn's beau, has been working on getting Harley in for years, and Harley is STILL not admitted. Rumor is if Harley doesn't get in this time, Harley might just leave him.
<br><br>
The Blood Moon Celebration is the perfect opportunity to prove your worth. You will charm,
outshine, and remind everyone that you are not just a contender—you are a queen. By the end of the night, the only question will be why it took them so long to let you in. And if they still refuse? Well, there are plenty of other ways to make yourself indispensable... or to make them regret it.

            Move with calculated elegance, your words sharp yet mesmerizing, and when faced with competition, offer a slow, knowing smirk before purring, “Mirror, mirror on the wall...”
