          <h4>Backstory</h4>
          <p>
            You are power, elegance, and strategy wrapped in eternal darkness. Once a feared warlord, you embraced vampirism to transcend mortality, becoming a creature of the night whose legend has only grown with time. Your castle is as much a symbol of your dominance as your very name— spoken in hushed tones by those who understand the weight of your influence. You do not chase power; it always comes to you.
<br><br>
When the Villains Vanguard was first conceived, it was you, Maleficent, Ursula, and Jafar who laid the foundation, bringing together the most formidable villains to seize control of the world. Over the years, the Villains Vanguard expanded, inducting new members only when the stars and moon align, ensuring only the most worthy are granted a seat at the table.
<br><br>
At one time, you were fully invested in the mission, but centuries of scheming can be exhausting. While you still enjoy your status, the endless plotting? That, you can do without. You've earned the right to step back, let others take the lead—so long as your position remains secure. But therein lies the problem. If the others sense your disinterest, they may no longer look to you as the unofficial leader. You need to ensure that doesn't happen.
<br><br>
Maleficent has always been your closest ally, your equal in command – or so you thought. At the last election, the two of you agreed to vote for Medusa, but at the last moment, Maleficent changed her vote, backing Cruella instead. Her reasoning? Cruella is easily controlled and would never challenge either of you. While her logic is sound, the betrayal stings. Worse, it shifted the balance of power ever so slightly—Cruella is now in Maleficent's debt, not yours. That cannot stand.
<br><br>
The upcoming Blood Moon Celebration is the perfect opportunity to realign your influence. You will be watching, listening, and—most importantly—choosing new allies. Maleficent may have made her move, but you are far from outmaneuvered. You'll ensure that your connections remain strong, subtly reminding the Villains Vanguard who truly holds the weight of history on their side.
<br><br>
One thing is certain: you will not be aligning with Loki. Chaos has never been your style—you prefer order, control, and precision. Joker, however, seems to have a personal grudge against Loki, which intrigues you. Perhaps there is an opportunity there.
<br><br>
As the Blood Moon Celebration approaches, you can't wait to attend. It will be a night of power,
and you intend to walk in as the legend you are. Let the others play their games—you are already ten steps ahead.
